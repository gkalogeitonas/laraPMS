| RQ‑001  | Multi‑Tenant      | Each tenant has isolated data and cannot view or modify other tenants’ properties or bookings.         | As a tenant admin, I want data fully isolated so no tenant can access another’s.                          | Tenant scoping enforced on every data query/operation; cross‑tenant access blocked at ORM and UI layers.                          | Functional      | Planned  | Dashboard (SCR‑002), Property List (SCR‑004), Booking Form (SCR‑003)  |
| RQ‑002  | User Management   | Secure registration and authentication, with role‑based and permission‑based access control.            | As a user, I want to sign up/log in securely and have permissions enforced.                                | Users can register, authenticate, and be assigned roles/permissions; unauthorized actions are blocked with feedback.               | Functional      | Planned  | Login (SCR‑001), Registration (SCR‑006)                                |
| RQ‑003  | Property & Room   | CRUD for properties and rooms, including listing and filtering capabilities.                            | As a tenant admin, I want to manage my properties and rooms so inventory stays up‑to‑date.                 | Admin UI provides forms and listings for properties/rooms, with filters by attributes (e.g., location, capacity).                 | Functional      | Planned  | Property List (SCR‑004), Property Detail (SCR‑007)                     |
| RQ‑004  | Bookings          | Create, update, and cancel bookings; track statuses; maintain a calendar view of availability.          | As a customer, I want to book, modify, or cancel a room; as an admin, I want a calendar of booking statuses. | Supports full booking lifecycle (new, update, cancel) and displays availability in calendar UI.                                    | Functional      | Planned  | Booking Form (SCR‑003), Dashboard (SCR‑002 - calendar view)            |
| RQ‑005  | Booking Sources   | Record the origin of bookings (website, third‑party) and allow reporting by source.                    | As an operations manager, I want to know where each booking came from to analyze channel performance.      | Every booking includes a “source” field; reports can aggregate by source type and date range.                                      | Functional      | Planned  | Booking Form (SCR‑003), Reporting Screen (SCR‑008)                     |

| RQ‑007  | Testing           | Automated tests using Pest covering core CRUD, authentication, and multi‑tenant constraints.            | As a developer, I want automated tests for core features to ensure stability and catch regressions.        | A suite of Pest tests verifies CRUD operations, auth flows, and tenant isolation; CI fails if any test breaks.                     | Non‑functional  | Planned  | N/A                                                                   |
